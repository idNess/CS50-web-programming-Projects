# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hey there!
This is my project0 for the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

This website is about Fancy Lemons, an imaginary company selling colored lemons. It is composed of 4 pages:
- Home
- Growing lemons
- Nutrition facts
- Contact us.

This folder contains:
- The index;
- img folder with all the images used in the web pages;
- ccs folder with the scss, css and bootstrap4 stylesheets;
- pages folder in which I stored all the html files of the other pages.

I hope you will enjoy my website.
All the best.
Vanessa Cicognani.
